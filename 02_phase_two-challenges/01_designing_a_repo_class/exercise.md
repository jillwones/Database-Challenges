# Designing a Repository Class

## Exercise:
Work in the same project directory music_library for this exercise.

Copy the Design Recipe Template and adapt it to test-drive and implement the two classes for the albums table.

You should skip step 1, as the table is already created in your database.

Write a small program in app.rb using the class AlbumRepository to print out the list of albums to the terminal.

## Challenge:
This is a process feedback challenge. That means you should record yourself doing it and
submit that recording to your coach for feedback. [How do I do
this?](https://github.com/makersacademy/golden-square/blob/main/pills/process_feedback_challenges.md)

To work on this challenge, first:
  * Setup a new project directory `book_store` [following the
    guidance](../pills/setting_up_database_project.md).
  * Create a new database `book_store`.
  * [Import this SQL seed into that new database.](../resources/seeds/book_store.sql)

Then, start recording yourself, and: 
1. Copy the [Design Recipe Template](../resources/repository_class_recipe_template.md) and
   adapt it to test-drive and implement the two classes for the `books` table. Since the table is already created, so you can skip step 1.
2. Write a small program in `app.rb` using the class `BookRepository` to print out the
   list of books to the terminal. You should get an output that looks roughly like this:

```bash
# In the project directory book_store

$ ruby app.rb
