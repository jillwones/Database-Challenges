# Challenge

You should create a new database `movies_directory` for this exercise.

Infer the table schema from these user stories.
```
As a person who loves movies,
So I can list all my favourite movies
I want to see a list of movies' titles.

As a person who loves movies,
So I can list all my favourite movies
I want to see a list of movies' genres.

As a person who loves movies,
So I can list all my favourite movies
I want to see a list of movies' release year.
```

1. Copy the Design Recipe template and use it to design the schema for that table.
2. Create the table by loading the SQL table file in `psql`.
3. To verify your work, make sure to run an `INSERT` query to insert a new movie record, and then a `SELECT` query to list the records.
