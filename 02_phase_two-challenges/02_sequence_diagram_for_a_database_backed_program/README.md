# Creating a sequence diagram for a database-backed program

* A diagram is easier to digest, present and discuss than a whole program made of written code. It is also easier to modify if it's needed.
* It will force you to think deeper about what is happening in your program, and to explain to yourself (and your peers) how the different components of the app is working. This will become very useful when it comes to debugging too.

**A sequence diagram** for a database-backed program helps us to explain and communicate two important things:
 * The interaction between the different components of the program and the database
 * The order in which the different parts interact together
