# Test-driving a Repository class "find" method

## Exercise

_Work in the project directory `music_library` you've worked on before._

Use the Design recipe document used to test-drive the `AlbumRepository#all`
method previously â€” following the steps 5 to 8 for the new `AlbumRepository#find` method. 

1. Test-drive and implement the method `find` on the `AlbumRepository` class. 
2. Modify the program in `app.rb` so it prints out to the terminal the data of the record
   with id `3`, using the new method.

I also test drove and implemented the method `find` on the `ArtistRepository` class too.
