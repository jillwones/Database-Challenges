# Challenge

Use the database `blog` you created [in this earlier challenge.](../challenges/06_designing_schema_two_tables.md#challenge)

1. Test-drive and implement the three classes for the `posts` and `comments` tables.

2. Write a small program in `app.rb` using the class `PostRepository` to print out the data of one post with its comments to the terminal.

Here is the [repo](https://github.com/jillwones/blog) with this completed challenge.
