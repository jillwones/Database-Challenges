# Database-Challenges

Objectives of this module:
  * **Design a database schema with at least two tables** from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL.
  * **Use SQL to query a database** to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete.
  * **Integrate a relational database to a program** by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.
  * **Explain how your program communicates with the database** by creating a sequence diagram.
